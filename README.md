# Applied Data Structures and Algorithms

I've heard this is a pretty tough class at Stevens -- it's mostly graduate students, so I'm expecting a bit more work than usual but we'll see!

I've never taken a college class with Java -- I'm self taught apart from an online course on Udemy that I looked through.  I'm hoping that was enough Java to at least get me started.
